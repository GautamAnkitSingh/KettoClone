## Further Improvements that can be made:
* As we know the saying ,  "there is always room for improvement" . Because nobody is perfect but we can work towards making things better , so we have some ideas to make our website functionality even more robust and better .

## Front-End Server:
* We are unable to implement functionality of "SignIn" since we are unaware about how to perform Google and Facebook verification , once we learn how to perform verification we will try to improve our "SignIn" functionality .
* We are unable to implement the functionality of "Fundraiser For" and "How It Works" due to time constraint but we will try to improve it .
* We are unable to implement the functionality of Whatsapp Chat due to lack of knowledge , once we will learn sufficient knowledge , we will work upon it for improvement.
* We are unable to implement functionality other than Medical due to time constraint , but we will work to improve it .
